# InputExample_SRTM.txt
# This is an example input file for Kestrel
# illustrating the setup of a simulation.
#
# This example sets up a simulation of a
# flow down a steep valley in Peru, using
# freely available SRTM topographic data.
#
# Text following a '#' are comments.

# The `Domain` block sets up the simulation location, size, resolution
# and boundary conditions.
# Note the resolution is given by Xtilesize/nXpertile (in metres).
Domain:
Lat = -11.28628 # Latitude of domain centre in decimal degrees
Lon = -76.83801 # Longitude of domain centre in decimal degrees
nXtiles =500 # Number of tiles along the Easting
nYtiles = 500 # Number of tiles along the Northing
nXpertile = 10 # Number of cells per tile along the Easting direction
nYpertile = 10 # Number of cells per tiles along the Northing direction
Xtilesize = 50 # Size of a tile in metres along the Easting direction
boundary conditions = halt # conditions at the domain boundary

# The `Source` block specifies a flux source (release of material over time).
Source:
  sourceLat = -11.22209 # Latitude of source centre in decimal degrees
  sourceLon = -76.85102 # Longitude of source centre in decimal degrees
  sourceRadius = 5 # Radius of the source in metres
  sourceTime = (0,  60, 600) # Time series of release
  sourceFlux = (0, 100,   0) # Volume flux of material in release at each time instance
  sourceConc = (0,   0,   0) # Volume fraction of solids in release at each time instance

# The `Solver` block sets some parameters for the numerical solver.
# Only T end is required.
Solver:
T end = 1800.0 # The end time of the simulation in seconds

# The `Output` block specifies options related to outputs from Kestrel.
Output:
N out = 20 # The number of temporal snapshot output files
directory = /Example_SRTM/ # Directory to hold output files
format = nc, kml # Output format, here NetCDF is selected

# The `Topog` block specifies the topography to be used in the simulation.
Topog:
Type = SRTM # Use SRTM topography. Note this will be reprojected and resampled to required resolution
SRTM directory = ./SRTM/ # Directory containing SRTM data. Note this should have the structure of an SRTM archive.

# The `Parameters` block specifies model closures and set parameters.
Parameters:
Drag = Chezy # Select Chezy drag
Chezy co = 0.04 # Set Chezy coefficient (dimensionless)
Erosion = Fluid # Select only fluid erosion
Erosion Rate = 6e-4 # Set fluid erosion rate (dimensionless)
Erosion depth = 1.0 # Set maximum erosion depth (m)
maxPack = 0.65 # Maximum solids packing fraction (dimensionless)
Bed porosity = 0.35 # Porosity of the bed (dimensionless)
rhow = 1000 # Density of water (kg/m^3)
rhos = 2000 # Density of solids (kg/m^3)
Erosion critical height = 0.01 # Minimum flow depth for erosion to occur (m)
Solid diameter = 1e-3 # Solids diameter (m)
Eddy Viscosity = 1e-2 # Turbulent eddy viscosity
Morphodynamic damping = rat3 # Select rational function for morphodynamic damping
Hindered settling = Spearman Manning # Select Spearman-Manning hindered settling closure

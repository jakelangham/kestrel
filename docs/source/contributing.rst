============

Though Kestrel has reached the point of usefulness for various research
applications, it remains under active development as we grow its feature base
and fix issues when they arise. We welcome contributions from anyone that would
like to help.

Here are some suggested ways you can contribute to improving Kestrel:

    * Report a bug or make suggestions / feature requests, by posting them on
      our `issue tracker <https://github.com/kestrel/issues>`_.
    * Fix an open issue and create a
      `pull request <https://github.com/jakelangham/kestrel/pulls>`_ so that it
      can be reviewed and integrated into the main code branch. This includes
      suggesting changes to the documentation, or adding example simulation
      scripts.
    * Add new features to the code, if you need them, and share your
      improvements via `github <https://github.com/jakelangham/kestrel>`_.  The
      easiest kinds of features to add are new model closures for drag/friction
      and morphodynamics, since relatively little development is required to
      augment Kestrel in this way. If you need some guidance to get started on
      working with the code, open an issue or use the contact info below.
    * Write a research paper that uses Kestrel and share your data openly
      (including your input files, so the simulations can be reproduced).

Thanks!
